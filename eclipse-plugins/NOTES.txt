Import project into Eclipse
----------------------------
Currently only developed against Gailileo

1)Create a workspace
2)Select from menu File->Import
3)Click General 
4)Click Existing Projects into Workspace
5)Browse for easyb plugin project root dir
6)Click Finish

NOTE To be able to access eclipse plugins source download the "Eclipse Classic" version of Eclipse as all plugins come 
with attached source.See http://www.vogella.de/articles/EclipseCodeAccess/article.html for details on how to view a plugins source

To launch the plugin from the project double click plugin.xml and select "Launch an Eclipse Applciation"  

Project Structure
-----------------
Standard plugin project structure except their are 2 lib directories
easyblib - Contains easyb runtime specific libraries needed to launch org.easyb.BehaviorRunner
pluginlib - Contains other libraries used by the plugin but not used by easyb

This seperation is necessary as the EasybRuntimeClasspathBuilder reads all the files in easyblib and 
appends to the classpath when launching a story. To reduce the risk of conflicts on the classpath
this should only have the minimum necessary to run easyb.

Story Launch
----------
1)Based on JUnit plugin at least in terms of the Launch UI.
2)Launch each story in a seperate JVM incase user wants to use a different JVM to the one running eclipse.
