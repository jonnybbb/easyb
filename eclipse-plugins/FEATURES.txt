1)Launch a story or multiple stories from shortcut or launch configuration

2)Have a better view on results rather then just logging to console

3)Have a seperate preference page where the user can specify the Groovy/easyb jars

4)Have a Create Story added to the File menu and package menus 
This would allow the user to add the Given,When,Then text in a wizard and the rest of the story code will be generated.

5)Provide editor support e.g error highlighting,maybe provided by other plugins like SpringSources Groovy plugin

6)Could integrate with issue reporting apps like JIRA,Collabnet,Bugzilla so when a user creates a story using the wizard 
they have an option to push the story to one of the issuer trackers.

7)Could also have that the other way so issuer trackers push stories to a project generating a story script 
though this could be pretty hard to do

8)6,7 could possibly be integrated with Mylyn

9)Could Hook 6,7 into continuous integration so story in issue tracker will have status changed to broken if a story fails.
 
10)Easyb eclipse plugin tests framework like the JUnit PLugin tests
    
11)I18N messages

12)Stop using jars bundled with a plugin either wrap jars in a plugin or use OSGi versions a lot of the bundling of jars 
has been done at Spring:-

Also turn easyb jar into a OSGi bundle.
