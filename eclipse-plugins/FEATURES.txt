1)Launch a story or multiple stories from shortcut or launch configuration
2)Have a better view on results rather then just logging to console
3)Have a seperate preference page where the user can specify the Groovy/easyb jars
4)Have a Create Story added to the File menu and package menus 
This would allow the user to add the Given,When,Then text in a wizard and the rest of the story code will be generated.
5)Provide editor support e.g error highlighting,maybe provided by other plugins like SpringSources Groovy plugin
6)Could integrate with issue reporting apps like JIRA,Collabnet,Bugzilla so when a user creates a story using the wizard 
they have an option to push the story to one of the issuer trackers.
7)Could also have that the othjer way so issuer trackers push stories to a project generating a story script 
though this could be harder to do
8)6,7 could possibly be integrated with Mylyn
9)Could Hook 6,7 into continuas integration so story in issuer tracker will have status changed to broken if a story fails. 
10)Easyb eclipse plugin tests
